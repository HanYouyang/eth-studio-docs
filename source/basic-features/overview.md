## Overview


When Ethereum Studio is properly installed and started for the first time, users will see a welcome page, where the dependencies for Ethereum are displayed, including Docker, Ethereum Node and Ethereum Truffle. Ethereum Studio Web does not have any local prerequisite, simply visit [Ethereum Studio Web](https://eth.ide.black) to start.

- **[Docker](https://www.docker.com/)** is used to start the Ethereum Node and compile projects in Ethereum Studio. If Docker is not installed yet, users can click the *Install Docker* button to visit the official Docker website and download and install it.
- **[Geth in Docker](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum)** is the Ethereum node image. Ethereum Studio uses the image to run the Ethereum node and compile projects.
- **[Truffle in Docker](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle)** is an Ethereum version of truffle used to create and compile projects.

When all the dependencies are properly installed and run, the gray *Skip* button will change into a violet *Get Started* button. Click the button to enter the main interface of Ethereum Studio.
