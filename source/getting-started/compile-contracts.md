## Build / Compile Solidity Contracts

Now one has three Solidity files in “ERC20/contracts/” file in left panel after creating project successfully. One can select the contract and click the “Hammer” icon to compile the contract. Besides, one can “Right click” the Solidity file and choose “Compile” to build. 

Now the IDE only support compiling all the contracts in the file together. The single-file compile will come soon.
