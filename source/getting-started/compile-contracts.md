## Build / Compile Solidity Contracts

Now one has three Solidity files in “ERC20/contracts/” file in left panel after creating project successfully. One can “Right click” the Solidity file and choose “Compile” to build. Besides, one can select the contract and click the “Hammer” icon to compile the contract.

Now the IDE only support compile all the contracts together. The single-file compile will come soon.
