Click the “Create” and one can generate the“Keypair info” including “Address” and “Privete Key” in the testnet **Rinkeby**. By keeping the “Private Key” secretly, one can control the assets in the “Address”. The “Address” will be used on the later process.

Input the keypair name and one can save this keypair and later choose it in the “Explorer” as identity.
